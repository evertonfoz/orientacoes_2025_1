abstract = {In real-time rendering, global lighting information that is too expensive to be computed on the fly is typically pre-computed and baked as vertex attributes or into textures. Prominent examples are view independent effects, such as ambient occlusion, shadows, indirect lighting, or radiance transfer coefficients. Vertex baking usually requires less memory, but exhibits artifacts on large triangles. These artifacts are avoided by baking lighting information into textures, but at the expense of significant memory consumption and additional work to obtain a parameterization. In this paper, we propose a memory efficient and performant hybrid approach that combines texture- and vertex-based baking. Cheap vertex baking is applied by default and textures are used only where vertex baking is insufficient to represent the signal. Seams at transitions between both representations are hidden using a simple shader which smoothly blends between vertex- and texture-based shading. With our fully automatic approach, we can significantly reduce memory requirements without negative impact on rendering quality or performance.}

abstract = {This paper describes a biologically motivated method of texture synthesis called reaction-diffusion and demonstrates how these textures can be generated in a manner that directly matches the geometry of a given surface. Reaction-diffusion is a process in which two or more chemicals diffuse at unequal rates over a surface and react with one another to form stable patterns such as spots and stripes. Biologists and mathematicians have explored the patterns made by several reaction-diffusion systems. We extend the range of textures that have previously been generated by using a cascade of multiple reaction-diffusion systems in which one system lays down an initial pattern and then one or more later systems refine the pattern. Examples of patterns generated by such a cascade process include the clusters of spots on leopards known as rosettes and the web-like patterns found on giraffes. In addition, this paper introduces a method which reaction-diffusion textures are created to match the geometry of an arbitrary polyhedral surface. This is accomplished by creating a mesh over a given surface and then simulating the reaction-diffusion process directly on this mesh. This avoids the often difficult task of assigning texture coordinates to a complex surface. A mesh is generated by evenly distributing points over the model using relaxation and then determining which points are adjacent by constructing their Voronoi regions. Textures are rendered directly from the mesh by using a weighted sum of mesh values to compute surface color at a given position. Such textures can also be used as bump maps.},

abstract = {As an important data source in 3D GIS, 3D landmark models are built to simulate the real-world scenario. However, due to the enormous volume and complexity of 3D models, the data transmission under limited bandwidth and the real-time rendering have always been an open problem. In order to improve the visualization and the efficiency, this paper proposes a novel model simplification algorithm in consideration of texture after the analysis of the existing model simplification approaches. Differing from the previous research, our approach defines a new error metric related to the model texture, which extends the vertex clustering scheme in 3D geometry space and 2D texture space independently. Since the uneven distribution of vertices is taken into account, the clustering unit is divided adaptively in consideration of both geometry and texture information. In view of reducing the memory overhead and improving the algorithm efficiency, we don’t create new vertices by iterative calculations, but use the inherent vertices in the initial meshes as the characteristic vertices. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our strategy, a series of simplification experiments have been carried out on the platform of DirectX 3D, a widely used 3D application programming interface. The results show that the simplified models in consideration of texture preserve more texture details than those traditional ones. It apparently makes a good balance between the reduction rate and visual effects.}
